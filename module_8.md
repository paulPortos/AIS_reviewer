# 🛡️ Information Security Defenses

## 🔒 Against Intentional Attacks

- **🛡️ Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**  
  Monitors activities within the network to detect attacks like DoS or MitM.

- **📋 Information Security Management System (ISMS)**  
  Tracks employee activities and creates risk assessments.

- **💽 Anti-Virus**  
  Prevents, detects, and removes malware.

- **🔥 Firewall**  
  Blocks unauthorized access to networks or devices.

- **🔄 Software Updates**  
  Fixes vulnerabilities, preventing zero-day exploits.

- **🛢️ SQL Injection Defense**  
  Validate inputs, use prepared statements, and follow secure coding practices.

## ⚙️ Against Unintentional Attacks

- **📚 Training and Awareness**  
  Educate users on account protection, secure practices, and threat recognition.

- **🚨 Disaster Preparedness**  
  Fire drills, equipment placement (e.g., servers above flood level), backup plans.

- **🔌 Power supply loss, 📡 ISP service loss, 🖥️ Server issues**  
  Use backup generators, alternate ISPs, and server redundancy.
