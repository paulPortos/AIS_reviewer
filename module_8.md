### Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in interconnected smart devices.

### Malware
- Malicious software such as viruses, worms, and trojans.

### Phishing
- Sending fraudulent emails or text messages to trick users into giving sensitive information.

### Zero-day Exploit
- Exploiting newly released software that hasn’t been tested against vulnerabilities.

## UNINTENTIONAL ATTACKS AND THREATS

### Coding Error
- Mistakes from developers, such as forgetting important code.

### Admin Error
- Accidental modification or deletion of data by administrators or users.

### Natural Disasters
- Storms, earthquakes, floods, etc.

### Power Supply Loss
- Brownouts or blackouts.

### ISP Issues
- Loss of communication due to faulty telecommunications.

### In Peripheral Devices
- Sensitive information visible on screens or devices from a peripheral view.

### Server Issues

# INFORMATION SECURITY DEFENSES

## Against Intentional Attacks

- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**  
  Monitors activities within the network to detect attacks like DoS or MitM.

- **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**  
  Tracks employee activities and creates risk assessments.

- **Anti-Virus**  
  Prevents, detects, and removes malware.

- **Firewall**  
  Blocks unauthorized access to networks or devices.

- **Software Updates**  
  Fixes vulnerabilities, preventing zero-day exploits.

- **SQL Injection Defense**  
  Validate inputs, use prepared statements, and follow secure coding practices.

---

## Against Unintentional Attacks

- **Training and Awareness**  
  Educate users on account protection, secure practices, and threat recognition.

- **Disaster Preparedness**  
  Fire drills, equipment placement (e.g., servers above flood level), backup plans.

- **Power supply loss, ISP service loss, Server issues**  
  Use backup generators, alternate ISPs, and server redundancy.
