## RMF Process

### **Step 1: Categorize Information Systems**
- Create priority levels (least to most important) for each identified risk.
- Set priority based on **likelihood** and **severity**.

### **Step 2: Select Security Controls**
- Choose controls for each listed risk.
- **Types of controls:**  
  - Physical  
  - Technical  
  - Administrative  
- **Control functions:**  
  - Preventative  
  - Detective  
  - Corrective  

### **Step 3: Implement Security Controls**
- Apply the selected controls to identified risks.
- May involve installing tools, assigning responsibilities, or conducting training.
- **Documentation** is essential to track implementations.

### **Step 4: Assess Security Controls**
- Check if selected controls are best for the situation.
- Consider **cost, coverage, and performance**.
- Modify or improve if necessary.

### **Step 5: Authorize Information Systems**
- Involves executives or high-level decision-makers.
- Approves the system based on assessments and accepted risk.
- May include issuing policies, memos, and ensuring compliance.

### **Step 6: Monitor Security Controls**
- Continuously monitor the environment and threats.
- Update or replace controls as risks evolve.
- Keep documentation up-to-date.
