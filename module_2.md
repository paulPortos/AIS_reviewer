========================
INFORMATION ASSURANCE (IA)
========================
Definition:
A set of measures intended to protect and defend information and information systems. It involves assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information/data, as well as the systems and processes involved.

IMPORTANCE OF IA:
- Information is an asset.
- Ensures that information remains usable, accurate, and secure.
- Prevents and responds to illegal activities (e.g., hacking, identity theft, data breaches).

IA PROCESS:
1. Enumeration & Classification of Assets – Identify and categorize valuable information.
2. Determine Vulnerabilities – Find weaknesses in assets.
3. Risk Assessment – Evaluate probability and impact of threats exploiting vulnerabilities.
4. Calculate Risk – Multiply threat impact by probability to assess severity.

FIVE PILLARS OF IA:
1. Availability – Ensure information is accessible when needed.
2. Integrity – Maintain accuracy and trustworthiness of data.
3. Authentication – Verify the identity of users or systems.
4. Confidentiality – Protect information from unauthorized access.
5. Non-repudiation – Prevent denial of actions or transactions.

========================
INFORMATION SECURITY (INFOSEC)
========================
Definition:
The practice of defending information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

TWO MAJOR ASPECTS OF INFOSEC:
1. Information Technology (IT) Security – Also called “computer security,” focuses on protecting technology systems.
2. Information Assurance – Ensures data is not lost during critical incidents.

========================
THREATS
========================
Definition:
A malicious act aimed at corrupting or stealing data, or disrupting systems.

Categories:
- Human-made (e.g., hackers, insider threats)
- System-related (e.g., configuration errors)
- Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods)

========================
TYPES OF SECURITY THREATS
========================

HUMAN & MANIPULATIVE THREATS:
- Social Engineering – Tricking people into revealing sensitive data by posing as a trusted entity.
- Third-Party Exposure – Breaches caused by vulnerabilities in vendors or service providers.

SYSTEM MISMANAGEMENT:
- Configuration Mistakes – Errors in system settings exposing vulnerabilities.
- Poor Cyber Hygiene – Unsafe practices like weak passwords, no updates, or no backups.
- Poor Data Management – Failure to classify/secure data, increasing risks.
- Weak Recovery Strategies – Lack of proper post-incident plans leading to repeated breaches.

CLOUD & DEVICE RISKS:
- Cloud Vulnerabilities – Storing data on cloud platforms without proper configuration, access control, or encryption.
- Mobile Device Risks – Use of unsecured personal or unmanaged mobile devices.
- Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks – Exploitation of connected devices with poor security.

MALICIOUS SOFTWARE:
- Ransomware – Malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.

========================
MEMORIZATION TIP:
========================
Remember the 5 Pillars of IA using the acronym AICAN:
Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality, Authentication, Non-repudiation.
