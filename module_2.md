# 📚 Information Assurance (IA)

**Definition:**  
A set of measures intended to protect and defend information and information systems.  
It involves assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information/data,  
as well as the systems and processes involved.

---

## 🌟 Importance of IA
- **Information is an asset.**
- Ensures that information remains **usable, accurate, and secure**.
- Prevents and responds to illegal activities *(e.g., hacking, identity theft, data breaches)*.

---

## 🔍 IA Process
1. **Enumeration & Classification of Assets** – Identify and categorize valuable information.
2. **Determine Vulnerabilities** – Find weaknesses in assets.
3. **Risk Assessment** – Evaluate probability and impact of threats exploiting vulnerabilities.
4. **Calculate Risk** – Multiply threat impact by probability to assess severity.

---

## 🛡 Five Pillars of IA
1. **Availability** – Ensure information is accessible when needed.
2. **Integrity** – Maintain accuracy and trustworthiness of data.
3. **Authentication** – Verify the identity of users or systems.
4. **Confidentiality** – Protect information from unauthorized access.
5. **Non-repudiation** – Prevent denial of actions or transactions.

# 🔐 Information Security (INFOSEC)

**Definition:**  
The practice of defending information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

---

## 🖥 Two Major Aspects of INFOSEC
1. **Information Technology (IT) Security** – Also called *“computer security”*, focuses on protecting technology systems.
2. **Information Assurance** – Ensures data is not lost during critical incidents.

---

# ⚠ Threats

**Definition:**  
A malicious act aimed at corrupting or stealing data, or disrupting systems.

**Categories:**
- **Human-made** *(e.g., hackers, insider threats)*
- **System-related** *(e.g., configuration errors)*
- **Natural disasters** *(e.g., earthquakes, floods)*

---

## 🛑 Types of Security Threats

### 👤 Human & Manipulative Threats
- **Social Engineering** – Tricking people into revealing sensitive data by posing as a trusted entity.
- **Third-Party Exposure** – Breaches caused by vulnerabilities in vendors or service providers.

### ⚙ System Mismanagement
- **Configuration Mistakes** – Errors in system settings exposing vulnerabilities.
- **Poor Cyber Hygiene** – Unsafe practices like weak passwords, no updates, or no backups.
- **Poor Data Management** – Failure to classify/secure data, increasing risks.
- **Weak Recovery Strategies** – Lack of proper post-incident plans leading to repeated breaches.

### ☁ Cloud & Device Risks
- **Cloud Vulnerabilities** – Storing data on cloud platforms without proper configuration, access control, or encryption.
- **Mobile Device Risks** – Use of unsecured personal or unmanaged mobile devices.
- **IoT Attacks** – Exploitation of connected devices with poor security.

### 🦠 Malicious Software
- **Ransomware** – Malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.

## 📝 Memorization Tip
Remember the **5 Pillars of IA** using the acronym:  
**AICAN** → *Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality, Authentication, Non-repudiation*
